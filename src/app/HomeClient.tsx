          <div className="mt-8 space-y-5 text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-600">
            <p>
              <strong>Landscaping in New York City</strong> is fundamentally different from landscaping anywhere else in the country. The challenges are unique — limited space, difficult access, strict building codes, co-op and condo board approvals, rooftop weight restrictions, and a climate that swings from brutally hot summers to freezing winters with salt-laden sidewalks. A landscaper who works in the suburbs simply isn&apos;t equipped for the complexity of a <Link href="/services/rooftop-gardens" className="text-green-600 underline underline-offset-2 hover:text-green-800">Manhattan rooftop garden</Link> or a <Link href="/services/landscape-design" className="text-green-600 underline underline-offset-2 hover:text-green-800">Brooklyn brownstone backyard renovation</Link>.
            </p>
            <p>
              That&apos;s where we come in. Our team works exclusively in the New York City metro area — we know the soil conditions in every borough, the sunlight patterns between buildings, the wind loads on rooftops at different heights, and exactly which plants thrive in which microclimates. We know which <Link href="/areas" className="text-green-600 underline underline-offset-2 hover:text-green-800">neighborhoods</Link> have sandy soil (looking at you, Rockaway), which have clay (much of the Bronx), and which have six inches of construction fill that needs to be replaced entirely.
            </p>
            <p>
              We also understand the logistics that make NYC projects uniquely challenging. Getting materials to a third-floor terrace in a walk-up? We&apos;ve done it hundreds of times. Coordinating crane lifts for rooftop planters? Standard procedure. Working around building management schedules, noise ordinances, and loading dock access windows? It&apos;s built into every project plan we create.
            </p>

            <Tip>The biggest mistake NYC property owners make is hiring a general contractor or suburban landscaper for urban outdoor work. A rooftop that isn&apos;t properly waterproofed or a planter that exceeds the structural load limit can cause catastrophic damage. Always hire a team with NYC-specific experience.</Tip>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 font-heading pt-4">Our Approach to Every Project</h3>
            <p>
              Every project begins with a thorough site analysis. We evaluate sunlight exposure throughout the day (urban shadows change dramatically by season), existing drainage patterns, soil composition, wind conditions, and structural capacity for rooftop and terrace work. We then present a detailed <Link href="/services/landscape-design" className="text-green-600 underline underline-offset-2 hover:text-green-800">design plan</Link> with 3D renderings, plant selections tailored to your specific microclimate, hardscape specifications, and an <Link href="/services/irrigation-systems" className="text-green-600 underline underline-offset-2 hover:text-green-800">irrigation plan</Link> that ensures everything stays healthy with minimal effort on your part.
            </p>
            <p>
              We believe in designing for all four seasons. Your outdoor space should look stunning in April when the dogwoods bloom, in July when the perennials peak, in October when the ornamental grasses turn gold, and even in January when the evergreen structure and <Link href="/services/outdoor-lighting" className="text-green-600 underline underline-offset-2 hover:text-green-800">landscape lighting</Link> carry the show. That&apos;s the difference between a landscaper who plants flowers and a landscape professional who creates an outdoor living environment.
            </p>

            <Tip>Ask your landscaper about &quot;four-season interest.&quot; If they only talk about spring and summer plantings, they&apos;re leaving half the year on the table. A well-designed NYC landscape should look beautiful 365 days a year.</Tip>

            There are hundreds of landscaping companies in the New York City area. Here&apos;s what sets us apart and why our clients stay with us year after year.

          <Tip>The cheapest landscaper is rarely the best value. In NYC, poor drainage installation can flood a basement, an overloaded rooftop planter can cause structural damage, and invasive plant species can take over in one season. Hire for expertise, not just price.</Tip>

          <Tip>NYC salt damage is one of the biggest killers of urban plantings. If your property borders a sidewalk or street, ask about salt-tolerant plant species and protective burlap wrapping for winter. A $50 burlap job can save a $500 shrub.</Tip>

            {[
              { num: "1", title: "Choose plants rated for USDA Zone 7a/7b", tip: "NYC sits in hardiness zones 7a and 7b. Plants rated for Zone 6 or lower will handle our winters easily. Avoid anything rated Zone 8+ unless it's in a sheltered, south-facing microclimate — it won't survive a typical February." },
              { num: "2", title: "Install drip irrigation, not spray", tip: "In NYC's tight spaces, spray irrigation wastes water on sidewalks, walls, and neighbors' property. Drip irrigation delivers water directly to root zones, uses 30-50% less water, and works perfectly in beds, planters, and rooftop containers." },
              { num: "3", title: "Go native whenever possible", tip: "Native plants like Black-Eyed Susans, Eastern Red Columbine, and Sweetspire are adapted to NYC's climate and require far less water, fertilizer, and pest control. They also support local pollinators — your garden becomes an ecosystem, not just decoration." },
              { num: "4", title: "Budget for drainage before aesthetics", tip: "NYC's clay-heavy soils and impervious surfaces create drainage nightmares. Before spending on beautiful plants and stonework, invest in proper grading, French drains, or dry wells. A flooded patio or waterlogged garden bed will destroy everything you plant." },
              { num: "5", title: "Use lightweight soil mixes on rooftops", tip: "Standard topsoil weighs 90-100 lbs per cubic foot when wet. Engineered lightweight mixes (perlite, vermiculite, peat) weigh 30-40 lbs. On a rooftop, this difference determines whether you can have a lush garden or just a few pots. Always get a structural assessment first." },
              { num: "6", title: "Plan for shade — most NYC spaces have it", tip: "Between buildings, fences, and trees, most NYC gardens get partial shade at best. Embrace it: hostas, ferns, astilbe, heuchera, and Japanese forest grass thrive in shade and look stunning. Fighting shade with sun-loving plants is a losing battle." },
              { num: "7", title: "Invest in landscape lighting", tip: "With limited outdoor space, NYC landscapes need to pull double duty — beautiful during the day, usable at night. Quality LED landscape lighting extends your outdoor hours, adds security, and transforms the mood of any garden, patio, or rooftop." },
              { num: "8", title: "Protect plantings from road salt", tip: "Salt spray from snowplows and sidewalk treatment damages plants within 10-15 feet of the street. Use salt-tolerant species near roads (bayberry, rugosa roses, ornamental grasses) and install physical barriers or burlap screens to shield sensitive plants in winter." },
              { num: "9", title: "Mulch everything, every year", tip: "A 2-3 inch layer of hardwood mulch suppresses weeds, retains moisture, regulates soil temperature, and looks clean and professional. In NYC's urban heat island, mulch is even more critical — it can reduce soil temperature by 10-15 degrees in summer." },
              { num: "10", title: "Start small, build over seasons", tip: "You don't need to do everything at once. A phased approach — hardscape year one, planting year two, lighting year three — spreads the cost and lets you adjust based on how you actually use the space. Good landscape design anticipates future phases." },

          <Tip>Great DIY landscaping projects in NYC: container gardening, annual flower beds, basic mulching, herb gardens. Projects that need a pro: drainage, hardscaping, irrigation, rooftop work, retaining walls, tree removal, and anything requiring a permit.</Tip>

          <p className="mt-6 text-sm text-slate-500">
            <strong>The ROI argument:</strong> According to the National Association of Realtors, professional landscaping returns 100-200% of its cost at resale. In NYC&apos;s competitive real estate market, a stunning outdoor space can be the difference between a quick sale and months on the market. <Link href="/contact" className="text-green-600 underline underline-offset-2 hover:text-green-800">Contact us</Link> for a free consultation to discuss your property&apos;s potential.
