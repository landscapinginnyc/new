            It Started With a Truck and a Grandfather

            <p>
              When you&rsquo;re 8 years old and your grandfather hands you a bucket of roses and says
              &ldquo;go sell,&rdquo; you don&rsquo;t think about career paths. You just hustle. That&rsquo;s
              how it started — out of the back of a truck in Queens, selling flowers on street corners
              with a man who taught me that everything worth building starts with your hands in the dirt.
            </p>

            <p>
              My grandfather didn&rsquo;t stay in that truck. He turned it into a storefront on Horace
              Harding Boulevard — <strong>The Rose Connection</strong> — a flower shop that still operates
              today. Watching him go from a truck to a real business taught me something that no degree ever
              could: if you show up every single day, if you care about what you&rsquo;re putting into the
              ground, people notice. And they come back.

              From Tarping Leaves to Running Crews
            </h3>

            <p>
              I started at the bottom — literally. Tarping leaves, hauling debris, loading trucks before
              sunrise. I worked my way up through <strong>Brickman Landscaping</strong>, one of the largest
              commercial landscape companies in the country, until I was running crews as a foreman. That&rsquo;s
              where I learned how to manage large-scale operations — commercial properties, HOA communities,
              corporate campuses — the kind of work where mistakes cost tens of thousands and deadlines don&rsquo;t
              move.

              A $6 Million NYC Park
            </h3>

            <p>
              Then came the project that changed everything. I was brought on to manage a{" "}
              <strong>$6 million New York City park</strong> — a project that was featured in{" "}
              <strong>Landscape Architecture Magazine</strong>. We&rsquo;re not talking about
              planting a few trees. We&rsquo;re talking about a complete urban transformation — grading,
              drainage systems, hardscaping, native plantings, irrigation, lighting — built to serve a
              community for decades. That project proved to me that landscaping isn&rsquo;t just maintenance.
              It&rsquo;s architecture. It&rsquo;s engineering. It&rsquo;s art.

              Redesigning NYC — One Property at a Time
            </h3>

            <p>
              After the park, I went deeper into urban landscape design — redesigning backyards in Brooklyn
              brownstones, building rooftop gardens in Manhattan, transforming concrete patios in Queens into
              outdoor living spaces. Every project in this city is different because every property is different.
              A 200-square-foot backyard in Park Slope has completely different challenges than a 2-acre estate
              in Scarsdale. And that&rsquo;s what makes this work exciting.
            </p>

            <p>
              I&rsquo;ve been doing this my entire life. Not because I chose landscaping — because landscaping
              chose me. It&rsquo;s in my blood. Three generations of it. From flowers on a truck in Queens to
              parks featured in national magazines to the company you&rsquo;re looking at right now.
