  { question: "What landscaping services do you offer in NYC?", answer: "We offer comprehensive landscaping services including landscape design, rooftop gardens, irrigation systems, outdoor lighting, lawn maintenance, hardscaping, snow removal, seasonal flower rotations, tree care, and more. We serve all five boroughs, Long Island, and Westchester." },
  { question: "Do you work in all five boroughs?", answer: "Yes. We provide full-service landscaping across Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, and Staten Island, as well as Long Island and Westchester County. Each area has unique landscaping needs and we tailor our approach accordingly." },
  { question: "How much does landscaping cost in NYC?", answer: "Landscaping costs in NYC vary based on project scope, property size, and materials. A basic garden cleanup might start around $500, while a full landscape design and installation for a brownstone backyard ranges from $5,000 to $25,000+. Rooftop gardens typically start at $10,000. Contact us for a free estimate tailored to your property." },

  { question: "What is the best time of year for landscaping in NYC?", answer: "Spring (March-May) and fall (September-November) are ideal for major landscaping work in NYC. However, we provide year-round services including winter snow removal, holiday lighting, and indoor plant care. Planning in winter allows us to begin installation as soon as the ground thaws." },
  { question: "Do you handle NYC permits for landscaping work?", answer: "Yes. Certain landscaping projects in NYC require permits from the Department of Buildings (DOB), especially rooftop installations, retaining walls, and significant grading work. We handle all permit applications and coordinate with building management and co-op/condo boards on your behalf." },
