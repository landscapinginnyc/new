                    Landscaping in New York City is fundamentally different from landscaping anywhere else. <strong>Space is limited, access is complicated, regulations are strict, and the environment is harsh</strong> — but the payoff is enormous.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A well-designed outdoor space in NYC isn&apos;t just aesthetically pleasing — it dramatically increases property value, improves quality of life, and creates a private retreat in the most densely populated city in America. Whether you&apos;re working with a 200 sq ft backyard in Brooklyn or a 2,000 sq ft rooftop in Manhattan, the principles are the same.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    NYC landscaping encompasses everything from <strong>garden design and planting</strong> to <strong>hardscaping</strong> (patios, walkways, retaining walls), <strong>irrigation systems</strong>, <strong>outdoor lighting</strong>, <strong>rooftop gardens</strong>, and <strong>year-round maintenance</strong>. The best NYC landscapes work with the city&apos;s unique constraints rather than fighting them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Key factors that make NYC landscaping unique: limited sunlight in many backyards due to building shadows, restricted vehicle access for material delivery, building codes and DOB permit requirements, weight limitations on rooftops and terraces, and four distinct seasons that demand year-round planning.
                  </p>
                  <Tip>Before starting any project, assess three things: (1) how much sun your space gets throughout the day, (2) how materials and equipment will access the site, and (3) whether you need any permits. These three factors drive every design decision.</Tip>

                    New York City falls in <strong>USDA Hardiness Zones 7a and 7b</strong>, meaning minimum winter temperatures range from 0&deg;F to 10&deg;F. This determines which plants can survive outdoors year-round. Choosing the right plants for your zone is the single most important decision in any landscaping project.

                      <p><strong>Full Shade (under 3 hours):</strong> Hostas, ferns, brunnera, Solomon&apos;s seal, lily of the valley, sweet woodruff, wild ginger, dead nettle</p>

                    <strong>Native plants</strong> are increasingly popular in NYC landscaping and for good reason — they&apos;re adapted to local conditions, require less water and fertilizer, support pollinators, and resist local pests. Top native picks include Eastern red columbine, Joe-Pye weed, New England aster, switchgrass, and Virginia sweetspire.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For <strong>container gardens</strong> (essential on rooftops and terraces), choose plants rated one zone hardier than your area (Zone 6 plants for NYC containers) since container soil freezes harder than ground soil. Alternatively, use frost-proof containers with insulation liners.
                  </p>
                  <Tip>The biggest mistake in NYC gardens: choosing plants that need full sun for a shaded backyard. Most NYC backyards get 3-4 hours of direct sun at best. Embrace shade gardening — shade gardens can be stunning with the right plant palette.</Tip>

                    Rooftop gardens are one of the most rewarding — and most complex — landscaping projects in NYC. They transform unused space into private gardens, entertaining areas, and green retreats above the skyline. But they require careful planning.
                  </p>

Saturated soil weighs 100-120 lbs per cubic foot. Most NYC roofs need reinforcement for extensive gardens." },
                      { factor: "Waterproofing protection", detail: "The existing waterproofing membrane must be protected. We install root barriers, drainage mats, and protection boards before any soil or containers go down. Damaging the membrane means leaks into the building below — an expensive mistake." },
                      { factor: "Wind exposure", detail: "NYC rooftops experience 2-3x the wind speeds at ground level. Plants must be wind-tolerant, containers must be weighted or secured, and structures (pergolas, screens) must be engineered for wind loads. Tall, top-heavy plants will not survive." },
                      { factor: "Irrigation access", detail: "You need a reliable water source. Most rooftop gardens connect to the building's water supply with a dedicated line and backflow preventer. Manual watering is impractical for anything beyond a few containers." },
                      { factor: "Building approval", detail: "Co-op/condo boards and building management must approve the project. Plans typically need to show structural engineering approval, installation methods, maintenance plans, and insurance coverage." },
                      { factor: "Lightweight growing media", detail: "Standard garden soil is too heavy for rooftops. We use engineered lightweight growing media that weighs 40-60% less than soil while providing proper drainage and root support." },
                    ].map((item) => (
                      <div key={item.factor} className="rounded-lg border border-slate-200 bg-white p-4">

                  <Tip>NYC offers property tax abatements for qualifying green roofs through the Green Roof Tax Abatement program. A certified green roof can reduce your property tax bill by $5.23 per square foot of green roof area, up to $200,000. This can offset a significant portion of installation costs.</Tip>

                <div className="mt-6 space-y-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-600">
                  <p>
                    Landscape lighting transforms outdoor spaces from daytime-only areas into year-round living spaces. In NYC, where outdoor space is precious, extending usability into evening hours effectively doubles the value of your landscape investment.
                  </p>
                  <p><strong>Key lighting techniques:</strong></p>
                  <ul className="ml-6 space-y-2 list-disc">
                    <li><strong>Path Lighting:</strong> Low fixtures along walkways and garden paths for safety and ambiance. Use 12-18&quot; tall fixtures spaced 6-8 feet apart.</li>
                    <li><strong>Uplighting:</strong> Ground-mounted fixtures aimed up at trees, architectural features, or textured walls. Creates dramatic shadows and depth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Downlighting (Moonlighting):</strong> Fixtures mounted in trees aimed downward to simulate natural moonlight. Soft, atmospheric effect.</li>
                    <li><strong>Accent Lighting:</strong> Spotlights highlighting focal points — specimen plants, water features, sculptures, or architectural elements.</li>
                    <li><strong>Deck & Patio Lighting:</strong> Recessed lights in steps, built-in bench lighting, and post cap lights for safety and atmosphere.</li>
                    <li><strong>String Lights:</strong> Classic overhead string lights for dining areas and entertaining spaces. Use commercial-grade LED strings for durability.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    All our installations use <strong>low-voltage LED systems</strong> (12V) for safety and energy efficiency. LEDs use 75% less energy than halogen, last 50,000+ hours, and generate minimal heat. Low-voltage systems don&apos;t require an electrician for installation.
                  </p>
                  <Tip>The #1 rule of landscape lighting: less is more. Overlighting makes spaces feel like a parking lot. Use warm white (2700K) LEDs and aim for pools of light with areas of shadow between them. The contrast creates depth and drama.</Tip>

                    Hardscaping — the non-plant elements of your landscape — is especially critical in NYC. With limited space, hardscaping creates usable outdoor living areas that maximize every square foot.
