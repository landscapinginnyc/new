  // ── Pricing ──
  {
    category: "Pricing",
    question: "How much does landscaping cost in NYC?",
    answer: (
      <>
        It depends on the service and borough. Lawn maintenance starts at $150/visit, landscape design from $2,500, rooftop gardens from $15,000+. Manhattan projects typically cost 1.3–1.5x more due to access logistics. <Link href="/pricing" className="text-green-600 underline underline-offset-2 hover:text-green-700">See our full pricing guide &rarr;</Link>
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    category: "Pricing",
    question: "Do you charge for estimates?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Never. Every estimate is free with no obligation. We visit your property, discuss your vision, and provide a detailed written quote within 48 hours. <Link href="/contact" className="text-green-600 underline underline-offset-2 hover:text-green-700">Request your free estimate &rarr;</Link>
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    category: "Pricing",
    question: "How do payments work?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Maintenance clients are billed monthly. Design-build projects follow a 30/40/30 structure — 30% deposit, 40% at midpoint, 30% on completion. We&rsquo;re flexible on larger projects. <Link href="/pricing" className="text-green-600 underline underline-offset-2 hover:text-green-700">Full payment details &rarr;</Link>
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    category: "Pricing",
    question: "Why does Manhattan cost more than Queens?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Access. Getting materials to a <Link href="/areas/manhattan" className="text-green-600 underline underline-offset-2 hover:text-green-700">Manhattan</Link> rooftop requires crane rentals, freight elevators, DOB permits, and sometimes DOT street closure permits. The work quality is identical — the logistics add cost. <Link href="/pricing" className="text-green-600 underline underline-offset-2 hover:text-green-700">See borough pricing multipliers &rarr;</Link>

Seasonal maintenance contracts include priority scheduling, locked-in pricing, year-round service including <Link href="/services/snow-removal" className="text-green-600 underline underline-offset-2 hover:text-green-700">snow removal</Link>, and save 10–15% versus per-visit pricing. <Link href="/contact" className="text-green-600 underline underline-offset-2 hover:text-green-700">Ask about seasonal plans &rarr;</Link>

    question: "What plants grow best in NYC?",
    answer: (
      <>
        NYC is USDA Zone 7a/7b. We recommend native species like Eastern Redbud, Sweetspire, Black-Eyed Susan, and Switchgrass for low-maintenance gardens. For shade: hostas, ferns, astilbe.

        1) Free on-site consultation. 2) Detailed written estimate within 48 hours. 3) Design phase with 3D renderings for design-build projects. 4) Scheduled installation. 5) Walkthrough and approval. 6) Optional ongoing <Link href="/services/lawn-garden-maintenance" className="text-green-600 underline underline-offset-2 hover:text-green-700">maintenance plan</Link>. <Link href="/contact" className="text-green-600 underline underline-offset-2 hover:text-green-700">Start with a free estimate &rarr;</Link>

  {
    category: "Process",
    question: "Do I need permits for landscaping in NYC?",
    answer: (
      <>
        It depends. Basic plantings and maintenance don&rsquo;t need permits. Structural work (retaining walls, rooftop gardens, fences over 6&rsquo;) may require DOB permits. Tree removal on city property requires Parks Department approval.

Many clients start with hardscaping in fall, plant in spring, add <Link href="/services/irrigation-systems" className="text-green-600 underline underline-offset-2 hover:text-green-700">irrigation</Link> and <Link href="/services/landscape-lighting" className="text-green-600 underline underline-offset-2 hover:text-green-700">lighting</Link> in summer.
